                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/1.jpg">
                <div style="color: black;">Kim Potter, the former Minnesota police officer who mistakenly drew a gun instead of a Taser and fatally shot Daunte Wright during a traffic stop, was sentenced on Friday to two years in prison.

                    The sentence comes nearly two months after Potter was convicted of first- and second-degree manslaughter. Prosecutors had requested seven years and two months while Potter's attorneys argued for a lesser sentence, pointing to her lack of a prior criminal history and remorse for Wright's death.
                    Potter will be required to serve two-thirds of her sentence in prison, or 16 months, according to state law. </div>

                <div style="color: black;">As surging global temperatures alter the landscape of the Arctic, scientists are observing what's shaping up to be a new record at the other end of the globe.

                    Preliminary data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center suggests Antarctica will likely set a record this year for the lowest sea ice extent -- the area of ocean covered by sea ice. On Wednesday, sea ice around the continent dropped lower than the previous record minimum set in March 2017.</div>

                <div style="color: black;">Greek authorities are searching for 11 passengers who are missing after a fire broke out on a ferry, forcing hundreds to be evacuated, the Hellenic Coast Guard said Friday.

                    The Euroferry Olympia ship had 239 passengers and 51 crew members on board when it caught fire northeast of the island of Ereikousa, close to Corfu, prompting an evacuation.
                    Two passengers who were trapped on board the ferry for several hours were rescued and airlifted to Corfu Friday afternoon, the Greek Fire Service confirmed to CNN.
                    The condition of the passengers, who are male and are foreign nationals, is not yet known.</div>

                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/4.jpg">
                <div style="color: black;">It has been about two decades since Microsoft and the US government went head-to-head in one of the country's biggest-ever antitrust battles. In the years since, Microsoft has managed to mostly stay off the radars of lawmakers and antitrust regulators, even as scrutiny of other tech giants has ramped up.

                    But with its plan to acquire popular video game developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI) for nearly $70 billion, Microsoft (MSFT) may be thrust firmly back into the antitrust spotlight.</div>
